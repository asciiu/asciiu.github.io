If you're serious about doing the thing you need stop talking about it. Don't even mention it to anybody. 

You need to work in solitude and in silence. Don't go telling people left and right that you have this great
idea and that so and so will change the world. You need to walk the talk before you can make those statements and talking about your idea or goals is not going to get your very far. If talking your ideas out to someone else is the only way you can validate your idea than you're not going to make it. 

I can't tell you how many times I wanted my partners to keep their mouths shut aobut what we were doing. But they just wanted to talk about things instead of doing the actual work. 

As the saying goes - "Talk is cheap!".
