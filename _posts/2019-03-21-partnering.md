title: Choosing Partners 
---

Before you go and find yourself other people to team up with on your project I want you to stop and challenge yourself to do as much as you can on your own.

Shared ideas are one thing, but if this idea is truly your own you really need test this idea out yourself by doing the work. You're going to be figuring things out on your own anyway as you realize how little work your partner is really doing.

1. don't lean on your other partners
2. you're going to argue a lot
3. other team members will not work as hard as you
4. Don't mix friendship with business. Just because you're good friends with this person does not mean that they are going to be good business partners.


it's better to work out your ideas in solitude and prove that you can do it yourself then to work out plan to get some other person to do it.
