Don’t tell anyone - NO body! You need to work in solitude and in silence. Talking about your idea is not going to get you anywhere. Do the work! Talking is what other people do. They do very little when it comes to doing the work. Why? It’s because most people seek validation by talking. It’s your idea, not theirs. You don’t need validation. You’re not a talker. You’re a doer. Test your ideas out on your own. Work on them. When it comes time to share your work with others show them. Show them how it’s going to be, and they will follow! Followers talk. You’re not a follower. True wisdom can’t be communicated by words. It must be obtained by direct experience." />

<p>If you’re serious about doing the “Thing” don’t talk about it. Don’t tell anyone - NO body!</p>

<p>You need to work in solitude and in silence. Talking about your idea is not going to get you anywhere. Do the work! Talking is what other people do. They do very little when it comes to doing the work. Why? It’s because most people seek validation by talking. It’s your idea, not theirs. You don’t need validation.</p>

<p>You’re not a talker. You’re a doer. Test your ideas out on your own. Work on them. When it comes time to share your work with others show them. Show them how it’s going to be, and they will follow!</p>

<p>Followers talk. You’re not a follower. True wisdom can’t be communicated by words. It must be obtained by direct experience.</p>
