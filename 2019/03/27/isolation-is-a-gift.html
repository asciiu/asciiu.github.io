<meta name="description" content="I would encourage that you do your own due diligence and work alone for as long as you can until you find the right people. Isolation is a gift in that it provides you an opportunity to continue working on yourself. If you don’t give up on your goals, the right people will find you. Don’t force a partnership or an employment situation just because you don’t want to pursue your goals alone. You have to drive yourself and not rely on others to push you forward. I think many people partner with friends or former work colleagues because they fear isolation. Forming business relationships on the sole basis that you get along well is not a good idea. There must be more than friendship in a business relationship. Good partners have a “shared” vision. If there is no shared vision, there will be contention. A shared vision is equality. If your partner keeps asking you what to do next or gets depressed because he can’t see results and thus stops doing any work, you’ve got yourself into a dilemma. The dilemma is, you’ll be managing these type of people. The vision may not always be perfectly clear, but it’s not your job to manage partners. A-Players do not need to be managed. An A-Player is someone like yourself. He/she understands the vision and will do whatever it takes to succeed. They will show up every day. They are aligned with what you are doing because they believe, and they will grow with you on your journey. Great products and services are created by teams that grow together as a unit. This is a must. If you do not grow as a unit, you will encounter contention as you or your team diverge in ideals or work output. I once worked with a man that wouldn’t challenge himself to learn new skills. He claimed that it was not “strategic” for him to do things outside of his skillset. A full year and some months later, I acknowledged that this partner was showing little signs of growth. I had outgrown him, and although we shared a common goal I was taking on more responsibility while his contributions stagnated. A shared vision and team growth are a must if you decide to partner with others. If you do not work together to keep the ideals of the vision balanced with the people that you work with, your team will undo itself. It will come apart like a fine rug undoing itself by the seams. If this happens don’t despair. I encourage you to move on. Isolation is the universe’s gift to you." />
